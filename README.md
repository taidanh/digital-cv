## Projects

---

### [C Tools](https://github.com/taidanh/ctools)
All of these tools were made solely by myself, on linux (Ubuntu), and in class

More information about the tools and their functionality can be found [in the repo](https://github.com/taidanh/ctools)

#### Key Technologies
- The C Programming language
- Linux
- Make
- lldb/gdb
- valgrind
- scan-build

#### Goal
The goal of all of these tools were to support the demands on larger projects, two of which were hamming encoder/decoder and Lempel-Ziv 78 data compression.

### [Astronomical Source Detection](https://github.com/taidanh/astronomical_source_detection)
This projects was made in collaboration with two other classmates (linked [in the repo](https://github.com/taidanh/astronomical_source_detection)) 

#### Key Technologies

- Python Programming Language
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Numpy
- SEP (Source Extraction and Photometry)

#### Goal
The general goal of this project was to explore common technologies that astronomers use, this project in particular focused on taking an image and labeling and numbering the astronomical objects.

#### My contributions

My main contribution to the project was all the code in `astronomical_source_detection.ipynb`, which was then built upon by my classmates in `ASTR-119(Hist).ipynb` and `Attemptatec.ipynb`

**Note:** The project layout is not optimal due to creating separate files to show who made what.

#### Usage
You can run my contribution by downloading the repo and running with `jupyter-notebook astronomical_source_detection.ipynb` once jupyter notebook is installed
