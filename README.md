## Projects

### [C Tools](https://github.com/taidanh/ctools)
All of these tools were made solely by myself, on linux (Ubuntu), and in class

More information about the tools and their functionality can be found [in the repo](https://github.com/taidanh/ctools)

#### Key Technologies
- The C Programming language
- Linux
- Makefiles
- lldb/gdb
- valgrind
- scan-build

#### Goal
The goal of all of these tools were to support the demands on larger projects, two of which were hamming encoder/decoder and Lempel-Ziv 78 data compression.


### [NCurse Sorting Visualizer](https://github.com/taidanh/ncurse-sorting)
The sorts from [C Tools](https://github.com/taidanh/ctools) were adapted to work with ncurses and there is a harness to use them from the command line.

#### Key Technologies
- NCurses
- The C Programming Language
- Linux
- Makefiles
- lldb/gdb
- valgrind

#### Goal
The main goal of adding ncurses to these sorts was to help visualize that was happening and it helped my debug where my counters for moves and compares should be.


### [Astronomical Source Detection](https://github.com/taidanh/astronomical_source_detection)
This projects was made in collaboration with two other classmates (linked [in the repo](https://github.com/taidanh/astronomical_source_detection)) 

#### Key Technologies

- Python Programming Language
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Numpy
- matplotlib
- SEP (Source Extraction and Photometry)

#### Goal
The general goal of this project was to explore common technologies that astronomers use, this project in particular focused on taking an image and labeling and numbering the astronomical objects.

#### My contributions

My main contribution to the project was all the code in `astronomical_source_detection.ipynb`, which was then built upon by my classmates in `ASTR-119(Hist).ipynb` and `Attemptatec.ipynb`

**Note:** The project layout is not optimal due to creating separate files to show who made what.
